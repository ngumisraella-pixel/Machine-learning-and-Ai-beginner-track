# Teaching Notes for Instructors

## Course Philosophy
- **Accessibility First:** Clear, beginner-friendly language
- **Practice-Heavy:** Each concept has multiple exercises
- **ML Context:** Every topic connects to machine learning
- **Progressive Complexity:** Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced

## Lesson Structure
Each lesson contains:
1. **Objectives:** What students will learn
2. **Theory:** Clear, concise explanations
3. **Code Examples:** Copy-pasteable working code
4. **ML Context:** Real applications
5. **Exercises:** Try It / Do It / Master It progression

## Time Allocation (Per Lesson)
- Lecture/Reading: 30 minutes
- Code Along: 15 minutes
- Exercises: 45 minutes
- **Total per lesson: 90 minutes**

## Full Course Timeline
- **16 lessons × 90 minutes = 24 hours**
- Homework + projects: 16 hours
- **Total: 40 hours (1 week intense, or 4 weeks relaxed)**

## Assessment Strategy
1. **Quizzes** (Quizzes/ folder) - Concept check
2. **Exercises** (Exercises/ folder) - Skill building
3. **Projects** (Projects/ folder) - Integration
4. **Self-Assessment** (ASSESSMENT-CHECKLIST.md) - Mastery tracking

## Recommended Adaptations
- **Visual learners:** Create diagrams for data structures
- **Kinesthetic learners:** Have them type all code examples
- **Struggling students:** Focus on Beginner exercises first
- **Advanced students:** Jump to Advanced exercises + ML projects

## Troubleshooting
- **"I don't get variables":** Show real-world analogies (containers for data)
- **"Why lists and tuples?":** Explain mutability difference with examples
- **"When do I use lambda?":** Show map/filter examples first
- **"How is this ML?":** Reference ML-CONTEXT-GUIDE.md
